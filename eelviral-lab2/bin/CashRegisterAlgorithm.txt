Cash Register Algorithm

Complete each of the following five items to create your algorithm.

1. List all of the input(s) and output(s).
	Input:
		- The amount of change (in cents) provided by the user.
	Outputs:
		- Number of quarters
		- Number of dimes
		- Number of nickels
		- Number of pennies


2. Figure out the computations needed to calculate outputs from the input.
	The outputs can be calculated from the input in two ways:
		Method 1: subtract each coin (quarter, dime, etc.) from the total in a loop
		and increment each until the total reaches zero.
		
		Method 2: perform a floor division against the total for each coin value (25 
		for quarters, 10 for dimes, etc.), until the total reaches zero.
	
	I decided to use method 1 to calculate the outputs for this lab.


3. Write all of the variable declarations needed for your inputs, outputs 
   and computational results.
	Variables declarations needed:
		- int q = 0; (for quarters)
		- int d = 0; (for dimes)
		- int n = 0; (for nickels)
		- int p = 0; (for pennies)
		

4. Translate the computations described into Java expressions and statements.
	(Computations translated on CashRegister.java)
	
	
5. Describe your algorithm in pseudocode: how you will collect input, perform
   calculations, and produce output.
	START Main
		GET cents as integer
		INIT quarters as integer = 0
		INIT dimes as integer = 0
		INIT nickels as integer = 0
		INIT pennies as integer = 0
		WHILE cents > 0
			IF cents - quarters > 0 THEN 
				INCREMENT quarters by 1
				DECREMENT cents by 25
			ELSE IF cents - dimes > 0 THEN
				INCREMENT dimes by 1
				DECREMENT cents by 10
			ELSE IF cents - nickels > 0 THEN
				INCREMENT nickels by 1
				DECREMENT cents by 5
			ELSE
				SET pennies = cents
				SET cents = 0
			ENDIF
		ENDWHILE
		IF quarters == 0 THEN
			PRINT "1 quarter"
		ELSE
			PRINT "n quarters"
		ENDIF
		IF dimes == 0 THEN
			PRINT "1 dime"
		ELSE
			PRINT "n dimes"
		ENDIF
		IF nickels == 0 THEN
			PRINT "1 nickel"
		ELSE
			PRINT "n nickels"
		ENDIF
		IF pennies == 0 THEN
			PRINT "1 penny"
		ELSE
			PRINT "n pennies"
		ENDIF
	END Main
