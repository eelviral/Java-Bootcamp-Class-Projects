Using the Clock program you created, perform the following
tests and record your observations.

1. What happens if you enter a String instead of a number?
A runtime error occurs because the scanner expected an integer
but got a string instead.

2. What happens if you enter an extremely large number, for 
   example: 3,000,000,000? 
A runtime error because the max range of an int that's
positive is 2,147,483,647.

3. What happens if you enter a negative number?
The output displays a logic error because the program only
expects positive numbers.

4. List and explain the Error Type for each of the above three cases
   based on your observations.
- Runtime error
- Runtime error
- Logic error
(All explanations above)
